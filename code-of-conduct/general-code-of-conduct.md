# General Code of Conduct

### Purpose

The Magento Association is dedicated to fostering and supporting technology projects, community events, training and education, and online collaboration. The Magento community has a rich history in building collaborative programs and successful events across geographies. The Magento Association is building upon that to complete the vision: An open, healthy and powerful Magento ecosystem for continued success of future generations.

As a volunteer, this is the main purpose that you are supporting.

* Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
* Our aim is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.

### Scope of this document

* We expect all community participants to abide by this code of conduct. 
* This includes sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests at all event venues, conference-related social events and online channels.
* This code of conduct and related procedures also applies to behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues _online and in-person_ as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

### Expected Behavior

* Be welcoming.
* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Participate in an authentic and active way.
* Look out for each other.

### Events

Meet Magento conferences and other meetups and events organized or coordinated by the association extend the best of the power of an open source commerce platform and an interconnected community. These events bring together an ecosystem of executives, marketers, developers, merchandisers, web designers, and more, of various countries, politics, religion, and ethnicity to share the latest inspirations, techniques, and strategies for transforming commerce.

**All Magento Events are Harassment-Free Zones**

Magento events strive to provide a harassment-free experience, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

All attendees, speakers, and sponsors are required to agree with this Code of Conduct. If you violate the Code of Conduct, you may be expelled from the premises without an explanation or refund at the discretion of event staff.

* Harassment of event participants in any form is not tolerated.
* Communication should be inclusive and appropriate for a professional audience.
* Do not insult or put down other attendees.
* Behave professionally and respectfully towards others.
* Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes or language are not acceptable.

We ask all attendees to report any acts that violate this Code of Conduct. If we hear that someone has been hassling or poaching developers, then we shall ask them to leave immediately.

**Respect Your Fellow Attendees** We support our attendees and ask that you support them too. Always be considerate and respectful to your fellow attendees.

Most of our events events are not formal. Attendees are encouraged to call each other by first name. The dress code is business casual, which may include a suit, shirt and jeans, dress, skirt, or button-up. We do not allow clothing that displays inappropriate pictures or text.

Talent pitchers and poachers are not allowed. Magento events are intended for learning, sharing, and encouragement. Aggressive talent pitching or poaching may result in your expulsion.

If you are not an official sponsor of the event, aggressive promotion of your company or product at the event will not be allowed. This includes for example spreading folders at or around the venue or bringing a large team dressed in your company clothing and thereby promoting your company/product.

While we want our attendees to enjoy the event experience, excessive drinking is not tolerated and may result in you being expelled from the premises.

**We are here for you** Thank you for making our events welcoming for all attendees. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.

### Unacceptable Behavior

  * Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
  * Do not show disrespect towards others. \(Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.\)
* Intimidation or harassment \(online or in-person\).
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Sustained disruptions.
